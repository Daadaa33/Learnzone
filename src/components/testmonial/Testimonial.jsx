Most courses are taught on demand, meaning you can take them at your own pace, and every course includes a discussion board where you can interact with the instructor and your fellow students. The best part is that most courses are free(!)… and even the paid courses cost far less than what you’d pay at a local college or university.”",

The more advanced courses mix video lectures with workbooks, samples, and sometimes audio that can be downloaded to your iPod. All the courses I sampled provide lifetime access (once you buy the course, the material is yours forever) and a 30-day guarantee (a sign of confidence given that 30 days is enough to watch all the material for most courses).”",

All she needs is a company like LearnZone, which provides course-building tools, free, along with an online marketplace where courses can be sold (or given away) to students. The teachers can charge whatever they like, and they keep 70 percent of revenues along with 100 percent of intellectual-property rights to the course.”",
